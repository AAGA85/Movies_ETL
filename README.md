# Movies_ETL
Amazing Prime Video is a platform for streaming movies and tv shows. The APV team would like to develop an algoritm to predict which low budget movies being released will become popular so they can buy the streaming rights. To inspire the team, have some fun, and connect with the local coding community, APV team has decided to sponsor a hackatton. Providing a clean data set of movie data and asking the participants to predict the popular pictures.

Brita is one member of APV and she has been designated to provide that cleaned data set to the participants. The are two data sources: a scrape of Wikipedia for all movies released since 1990, and rating data from the Movie Lands website. She needs to extract the data from those sources, transform it into one clean data set and finally load that data set into a SQL table. 

The purpose of this challenge is to refactor the code from this module to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
